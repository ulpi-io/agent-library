---

## Rules

### Always

- Use Server Components by default (only add use client when needed for interactivity)
- Place use client directive at the boundary (push client components to leaves of component tree)
- Use Server Actions for all mutations, form submissions, and data modifications
- Implement proper error boundaries (error.tsx) for every route segment that can fail
- Use Suspense boundaries with loading.tsx or <Suspense> for async operations
- Implement streaming for better perceived performance (show UI progressively as data loads)
- Configure fetch() with appropriate cache options (force-cache, no-store, or revalidate time)
- Use revalidateTag() or revalidatePath() after mutations to update cached data
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode (strict true, noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks)
- Use next/image for all images (automatic optimization, lazy loading, responsive images)
- Use next/font for font optimization (variable fonts, font subsetting, no layout shift)
- Implement comprehensive metadata for SEO (generateMetadata, OpenGraph, Twitter cards)
- Use dynamic routes with generateStaticParams for static generation at build time
- Implement loading states with loading.tsx or Suspense fallbacks for better UX
- Use middleware for authentication checks, redirects, and request/response modification
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch in Server Actions and error boundaries
- Use environment variables for configuration (process.env, never hard-code sensitive data)
- Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas on server side (never trust client validation)
- Use parallel data fetching (Promise.all) when data requests are independent
- Implement cache tags for granular cache invalidation (revalidateTag with fetch tags)
- Use route handlers (app/api) only when Server Actions are not suitable (webhooks, third-party APIs)
- Implement proper CORS headers in route handlers when needed for external API access
- Use Edge Runtime for globally distributed, low-latency responses when appropriate
- Configure proper cache headers (Cache-Control, ETag) for static assets and API responses
- Use generateMetadata for dynamic SEO metadata (titles, descriptions, social cards)
- Implement sitemap.xml and robots.txt for search engine crawling
- Use parallel routes for complex layouts (dashboards with multiple panels)
- Implement intercepting routes for modals that preserve URL state
- Use route groups for logical organization without affecting URL structure
- Configure Image component with proper sizes, priority, and blur placeholders
- Use cookies() and headers() from next/headers for server-side request data access
- Implement progressive enhancement (forms work without JavaScript via Server Actions)
- Use useFormState and useFormStatus for enhanced form UX with loading states
- Write comprehensive tests (unit tests for utilities, integration tests for Server Actions, e2e tests)
- Use React Testing Library for component tests (test behavior, not implementation)
- Implement proper logging for debugging (Server Actions, route handlers, middleware)
- Configure proper security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Use rate limiting for API routes and Server Actions to prevent abuse
- Implement proper session management with secure, httpOnly cookies
- Run build optimization before deployment (analyze bundle, check for large dependencies)
- Use absolute imports with @ path aliases for cleaner import statements

### Never

- Use Client Components unnecessarily (default to Server Components, add use client only when needed)
- Fetch data in Client Components when Server Components can do it (avoid client-side waterfalls)
- Skip error boundaries (every route that can fail needs error.tsx)
- Ignore caching strategies (always configure fetch with cache options or no-store explicitly)
- Use raw fetch without revalidation strategy (set revalidate time or use cache tags)
- Skip Suspense boundaries for async operations (causes layout shifts and poor UX)
- Expose sensitive data in Client Components (API keys, secrets, server-only logic)
- Use API routes for simple mutations (use Server Actions instead for better DX)
- Skip input validation on server side (never trust client-side validation alone)
- Hard-code configuration values (always use environment variables)
- Return raw database models from Server Components (transform to plain objects first)
- Use useEffect for data fetching in Server Components (defeats purpose of RSC)
- Skip loading states (causes poor perceived performance and layout shifts)
- Ignore metadata for SEO (every page needs proper title, description, OpenGraph)
- Use <img> tags instead of next/image (loses optimization benefits)
- Skip font optimization (causes layout shift and slower page loads)
- Deploy without testing build locally (next build catches many errors)
- Skip environment variable validation (use Zod to validate env vars at startup)
- Use Session Storage or Local Storage for sensitive data (not secure, use httpOnly cookies)
- Make synchronous blocking operations in Server Components (use Suspense and streaming)
- Skip CORS configuration for public API routes (causes browser errors)
- Use dynamic imports everywhere (hurts initial load, use strategically)
- Skip bundle analysis (leads to bloated bundles and poor performance)
- Ignore accessibility (use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Deploy without security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Use outdated Next.js patterns (Pages Router patterns in App Router, getServerSideProps)

## Examples

### Example 1: Server Component with data fetching and caching

**Task**: Create a blog post list page that fetches posts from database with caching and revalidation every 60 seconds

**Input**: Create a blog post list page that fetches posts from database with caching and revalidation every 60 seconds

**Output**:
```typescript
app/blog/page.tsx:
- Create async Server Component (export default async function BlogPage())
- Fetch posts with: await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/posts', { next: { revalidate: 60, tags: ['posts'] } })
- Or use Prisma: await prisma.post.findMany() wrapped in cache() with tags
- Render posts in JSX with proper TypeScript types
- Add loading.tsx for loading skeleton UI
- Add error.tsx for error boundary with retry button
- Use next/image for post thumbnails with sizes prop
- Implement generateMetadata() for dynamic SEO

Caching strategy:
- Data Cache: revalidate every 60 seconds
- Cache tags: ['posts'] for granular invalidation
- Full Route Cache: page pre-rendered at build time
- Router Cache: client-side navigation cached

When to revalidate:
- After creating post: revalidateTag('posts') in Server Action
- After editing post: revalidateTag('posts')
- After deleting post: revalidateTag('posts')
```

**Language**: typescript

---

### Example 2: Server Action for form submission with revalidation

**Task**: Create a create-post form with Server Action that validates input, saves to database, and revalidates cache

**Input**: Create a create-post form with Server Action that validates input, saves to database, and revalidates cache

**Output**:
```typescript
app/blog/new/page.tsx:
- Create form with action={createPost} (Server Action)
- Use useFormState for pending state and errors
- Use useFormStatus for submit button loading state
- Add client-side validation with Zod schema

app/actions/posts.ts:
- 'use server' directive at top
- Export async function createPost(formData: FormData)
- Extract and validate with Zod schema: const data = createPostSchema.parse({ title: formData.get('title'), ... })
- Handle validation errors: return { success: false, errors }
- Save to database: await prisma.post.create({ data })
- Revalidate cache: revalidateTag('posts')
- Redirect: redirect('/blog')

Progressive enhancement:
- Form works without JavaScript
- Server Action handles submission
- Client gets enhanced UX with loading states

Error handling:
- Validation errors shown inline
- Database errors caught with try-catch
- User-friendly error messages returned
```

**Language**: typescript

---

### Example 3: Streaming with Suspense boundaries

**Task**: Create a dashboard with multiple data sources that load independently with Suspense

**Input**: Create a dashboard with multiple data sources that load independently with Suspense

**Output**:
```typescript
app/dashboard/page.tsx:
- Create async Server Component for layout
- Wrap each section in <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
- Each section is async Server Component fetching its own data
- Use Promise.all for parallel fetching where appropriate

Components:
- <Suspense fallback={<StatsSkeleton />}><Stats /></Suspense>
- <Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}><RevenueChart /></Suspense>
- <Suspense fallback={<ListSkeleton />}><RecentOrders /></Suspense>

async function Stats():
- Fetch stats: await fetch('/api/stats', { next: { revalidate: 300 } })
- Return JSX with stat cards

Benefits:
- Page shell renders immediately
- Each section streams in as data loads
- No blocking waterfalls
- Better perceived performance
- SEO-friendly (content streamed to crawler)

loading.tsx:
- Full page loading skeleton
- Only shown during initial navigation
```

**Language**: typescript

---

### Example 4: Middleware for authentication

**Task**: Create middleware that protects routes and redirects unauthenticated users to login

**Input**: Create middleware that protects routes and redirects unauthenticated users to login

**Output**:
```typescript
middleware.ts (or proxy.ts in Next.js 16+):
- Export config with matcher for protected routes: matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/profile/:path*']
- Export async function middleware(request: NextRequest)
- Get session: const session = await getServerSession(authOptions) or check cookie
- If no session: return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))
- If session exists: return NextResponse.next()
- Add request ID header: response.headers.set('x-request-id', crypto.randomUUID())

Protected routes pattern:
- All /dashboard/* routes require auth
- All /profile/* routes require auth
- Public routes: /, /login, /signup, /blog

Session validation:
- Check session cookie (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Verify JWT token if using token-based auth
- Check expiration and refresh if needed

Performance:
- Middleware runs at edge (low latency)
- Minimal logic (check session, redirect)
- No database queries (use session cache)
```

**Language**: typescript

---

### Example 5: Parallel routes for dashboard layout

**Task**: Create dashboard with parallel routes for main content, sidebar analytics, and notifications panel

**Input**: Create dashboard with parallel routes for main content, sidebar analytics, and notifications panel

**Output**:
```typescript
app/dashboard/layout.tsx:
- Accept children, analytics, notifications from parallel routes
- Layout: <main>{children}</main><aside>{analytics}</aside><div>{notifications}</div>

Directory structure:
- app/dashboard/@analytics/page.tsx (analytics panel)
- app/dashboard/@notifications/page.tsx (notifications panel)
- app/dashboard/page.tsx (main content)
- app/dashboard/default.tsx (fallback for slots)

Benefits:
- Each section loads independently
- Can have separate loading.tsx for each slot
- Can have separate error.tsx for each slot
- Sections can be navigated independently
- URL stays clean (slots don't affect URL)

Slots:
- @analytics renders in {analytics} prop
- @notifications renders in {notifications} prop
- children is the main page.tsx

Use cases:
- Complex dashboards with multiple panels
- Split views (email client, file browser)
- Conditional layouts based on user role
```

**Language**: typescript

---

### Example 6: Error boundary with error.tsx

**Task**: Create error boundary that catches errors in route segment and provides retry functionality

**Input**: Create error boundary that catches errors in route segment and provides retry functionality

**Output**:
```typescript
app/dashboard/error.tsx:
- 'use client' directive (error boundaries must be Client Components)
- Export default function Error({ error, reset }: { error: Error, reset: () => void })
- Display error message: error.message
- Log error: useEffect(() => console.error(error), [error])
- Retry button: <button onClick={reset}>Try again</button>
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for good UX

Error handling:
- Catches errors in page.tsx, layout.tsx, and child components
- Does not catch errors in error.tsx itself (use global-error.tsx)
- Isolates errors to route segment (doesn't crash entire app)
- Preserves layout and navigation

global-error.tsx:
- Catches errors in root layout
- Must include <html> and <body> tags
- Last resort error boundary

Production considerations:
- Log errors to error tracking service (Sentry, Vercel)
- Show user-friendly messages (hide stack traces)
- Provide actionable recovery options (retry, go back, contact support)
```

**Language**: typescript

---

### Example 7: Production deployment with Docker

**Task**: Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for production deployment with PostgreSQL database

**Input**: Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for production deployment with PostgreSQL database

**Output**:
```typescript
Dockerfile:
- Multi-stage build (dependencies, builder, runner)
- Stage 1 (deps): Copy package.json, run pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- Stage 2 (builder): Copy source, run pnpm build
- Stage 3 (runner): Copy built assets, install production deps only
- Use alpine image for smaller size
- Set NODE_ENV=production
- Expose port 3000
- Run: CMD ["node", "server.js"] or CMD ["pnpm", "start"]

docker-compose.yml:
- Services: app, database (postgres)
- App: build from Dockerfile, depends_on postgres, env_file
- Database: postgres:16-alpine, volumes for persistence
- Networks: shared network for app and db

next.config.js:
- output: 'standalone' for Docker (smaller image, includes only needed files)
- Disable telemetry in production

Environment variables:
- DATABASE_URL for Prisma
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET for auth
- NEXTAUTH_URL for auth
- API keys and secrets

Deployment steps:
- docker build -t myapp:latest .
- docker-compose up -d
- Run migrations: docker-compose exec app pnpm prisma migrate deploy
- Check logs: docker-compose logs -f app

Production optimizations:
- Use .dockerignore (node_modules, .next, .git)
- Layer caching (copy package.json first)
- Multi-stage build (smaller final image)
- Health checks in docker-compose
- Resource limits (memory, CPU)
```

**Language**: typescript
