# Agent Matching Logic Reference

This document provides comprehensive rules, patterns, and decision trees for matching tasks to the appropriate specialized agent persona in the start skill workflow.

## Core Principle

**Always use the RIGHT agent for the RIGHT job.** Specialized agents have deep domain expertise that produces higher quality output than general-purpose implementation. The start skill's primary responsibility is identifying when to delegate vs when to execute directly.

---

## Delegation Decision Tree

### Step 1: Check Task Complexity

```
Is the task trivial? (single-file typo fix, simple read, etc.)
├─ YES → Skip agent delegation, execute directly
└─ NO → Continue to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Identify Technology Stack

```
Scan codebase for technology indicators:
├─ Laravel detected (*.php, /app/, composer.json with laravel/framework)
│  └─ Task involves Laravel work? → laravel-senior-engineer
├─ Next.js detected (next.config.*, /app/ with *.tsx, package.json with next)
│  └─ Task involves Next.js work? → nextjs-senior-engineer
├─ NestJS detected (nest-cli.json, @nestjs/* dependencies)
│  └─ Task involves NestJS work? → nestjs-senior-engineer
├─ Remix detected (remix.config.*, @remix-run/*)
│  └─ Task involves Remix work? → remix-senior-engineer
├─ Express detected (express dependency, but NOT NestJS)
│  └─ Task involves Express work? → express-senior-engineer
├─ Expo detected (app.json, expo dependency)
│  └─ Task involves Expo/React Native work? → expo-react-native-senior-engineer
├─ Flutter detected (pubspec.yaml, *.dart)
│  └─ Task involves Flutter work? → flutter-senior-engineer
├─ Magento detected (/app/code/, module.xml, Magento namespaces)
│  └─ Task involves Magento work? → magento-senior-engineer
└─ No framework detected
   └─ Use general-purpose or Explore agent
```

### Step 3: Assess Task Type

```
What type of work is required?
├─ Feature building (new functionality) → Delegate to specialized agent
├─ Bug fixing/debugging → Delegate to specialized agent
├─ Refactoring → Delegate to specialized agent
├─ Exploration/discovery → Use Explore agent or general-purpose
└─ Simple edits → Execute directly
```

### Step 4: Validate Independence (for parallel work)

```
Are there 3+ independent tasks?
├─ YES → Consider run-parallel-agents-feature-build skill
└─ NO → Delegate to single appropriate agent
```

## Matching Algorithm

### Algorithm: Match Task to Agent

```python
def match_agent(task, codebase_context):
    # Step 1: Check for explicit framework mention
    if "Laravel" in task or "Eloquent" in task:
        return "laravel-senior-engineer"
    if "Next.js" in task or "Server Action" in task:
        return "nextjs-senior-engineer"
    if "NestJS" in task or "@nestjs" in task:
        return "nestjs-senior-engineer"
    if "Remix" in task or "loader" in task and "action" in task:
        return "remix-senior-engineer"
    if "Express" in task and "NestJS" not in task:
        return "express-senior-engineer"
    if "Expo" in task or "React Native" in task:
        return "expo-react-native-senior-engineer"
    if "Flutter" in task or "widget" in task:
        return "flutter-senior-engineer"
    if "Magento" in task:
        return "magento-senior-engineer"

    # Step 2: Analyze codebase indicators
    frameworks = detect_frameworks(codebase_context)

    if "laravel" in frameworks:
        return "laravel-senior-engineer"
    if "nextjs" in frameworks:
        return "nextjs-senior-engineer"
    if "nestjs" in frameworks:
        return "nestjs-senior-engineer"
    if "remix" in frameworks:
        return "remix-senior-engineer"
    if "express" in frameworks and "nestjs" not in frameworks:
        return "express-senior-engineer"
    if "expo" in frameworks:
        return "expo-react-native-senior-engineer"
    if "flutter" in frameworks:
        return "flutter-senior-engineer"
    if "magento" in frameworks:
        return "magento-senior-engineer"

    # Step 3: Default to general-purpose
    return "general-purpose"

def detect_frameworks(codebase_context):
    frameworks = []

    # File-based detection
    if "next.config.js" in codebase_context or "next.config.ts" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("nextjs")
    if "nest-cli.json" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("nestjs")
    if "remix.config.js" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("remix")
    if "composer.json" in codebase_context and "laravel/framework" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("laravel")
    if "app.json" in codebase_context and "expo" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("expo")
    if "pubspec.yaml" in codebase_context and "flutter" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("flutter")
    if "module.xml" in codebase_context or "/app/code/" in codebase_context:
        frameworks.append("magento")
    if "package.json" in codebase_context and "express" in codebase_context:
        if "nestjs" not in frameworks:
            frameworks.append("express")

    return frameworks
```

## Multi-Agent Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Full-Stack Feature

**User Request:** "Build user profile with backend API and frontend page"

**Analysis:**
- Backend API → Identify backend framework (Laravel, NestJS, Express)
- Frontend page → Identify frontend framework (Next.js, Remix)

**Decision:**
- If 2 independent parts → Use `run-parallel-agents-feature-build`
- Split into:
  - Backend agent (framework-specific)
  - Frontend agent (framework-specific)

### Scenario 2: Multi-Framework Codebase

**User Request:** "Fix authentication across the stack"

**Analysis:**
- Authentication touches: Laravel backend + Next.js frontend
- Are they independent fixes or interconnected?

**Decision:**
- If interconnected (shared logic) → Sequential fixes, start with backend
- If independent bugs → Parallel agents

### Scenario 3: Exploration Task

**User Request:** "Find all API endpoints in the codebase"

**Analysis:**
- Discovery task, spans multiple potential frameworks
- Not building/fixing, just exploring

**Decision:**
- Use `Explore` agent with `subagent_type=Explore`
- NOT a specialized framework agent

---

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Ambiguous File Extensions

**Problem:** TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`) used by Next.js, Remix, NestJS, Express, Expo

**Solution Priority:**
1. Check for framework config files
2. Examine directory structure
3. Look at import statements
4. Default to most common in project

**Example:**
```
File: src/components/Button.tsx

Indicators to check:
- Is there a next.config.js? → Next.js
- Is there a nest-cli.json? → NestJS
- Is there a remix.config.js? → Remix
- Is there an app.json with Expo? → Expo
- None? → Check imports for 'next/*', '@nestjs/*', '@remix-run/*', 'expo'
```

### Edge Case 2: Mixed Technology Project

**Problem:** Project has Laravel backend AND Next.js frontend in same repo

**Solution:**
- Identify which part the task targets based on:
  - File paths mentioned
  - Keywords in request ("API" → backend, "page" → frontend)
  - Explicit user mention

**Example:**
```
User: "Add user authentication"
Ambiguous! Could be:
- Laravel API authentication
- Next.js frontend auth UI
- Both

→ Use AskUserQuestion to clarify
```

### Edge Case 3: Unknown Framework

**Problem:** Framework not in catalog (e.g., SvelteKit, Nuxt.js, Django)

**Solution:**
- Use `general-purpose` agent
- Mention limitation to user
- Provide best-effort support

### Edge Case 4: Pure Language Without Framework

**Problem:** Raw PHP, raw TypeScript, raw Dart without framework

**Solution:**
- Use `general-purpose` agent
- Still effective for non-framework-specific work

---

## Confidence Scoring System

When matching agents, assign confidence:

### High Confidence (90-100%)
- Framework config file exists
- Explicit user mention of framework
- Clear code patterns match framework
- **Action:** Confidently delegate to specialized agent

### Medium Confidence (60-89%)
- File patterns suggest framework
- Directory structure matches
- Some code patterns present
- **Action:** Delegate but mention assumption to user

### Low Confidence (30-59%)
- Weak indicators
- Could be multiple frameworks
- **Action:** Use AskUserQuestion to clarify OR use general-purpose

### Very Low (<30%)
- No clear indicators
- **Action:** Use general-purpose

---

## Delegation Brief Template

When delegating to a specialized agent, use this template:

```
Task: [Brief description]

Technology Stack: [Framework identified]

Context:
- Existing patterns: [What you discovered in codebase exploration]
- Related files: [Relevant file paths]
- Dependencies: [What systems this interacts with]

Requirements:
- [Bullet point 1]
- [Bullet point 2]
- [Bullet point 3]

Expected Output:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

Success Criteria:
- [How to verify completion]
- [Test requirements]
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Doing Specialized Work Yourself

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Build Laravel API endpoint"
Assistant: *Writes Laravel code directly without delegating*
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Build Laravel API endpoint"
Assistant: *Identifies Laravel, delegates to laravel-senior-engineer*
```

**Why:** Specialized agents have deep expertise that produces better results.

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Using Wrong Agent

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Fix NestJS service"
Assistant: *Delegates to express-senior-engineer (both Node.js)*
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Fix NestJS service"
Assistant: *Correctly identifies NestJS, delegates to nestjs-senior-engineer*
```

**Why:** Framework-specific patterns and best practices differ significantly.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Skipping Agent for "Simple" Tasks

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Add simple Laravel validation rule"
Assistant: "This is simple, I'll do it directly"
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Add simple Laravel validation rule"
Assistant: *Still delegates to laravel-senior-engineer for framework expertise*
```

**Why:** Even "simple" tasks benefit from domain expertise and pattern knowledge.

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Ignoring Multiple Frameworks

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Fix auth in Laravel backend and Next.js frontend"
Assistant: *Tries to do both without recognizing it's two different domains*
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Fix auth in Laravel backend and Next.js frontend"
Assistant: *Recognizes two frameworks, splits into parallel agents or sequential fixes*
```

**Why:** Different frameworks require different expertise.

---

## Quick Reference: Agent Selection Checklist

Before delegating, verify:

- [ ] I have identified the technology stack correctly
- [ ] I have selected the appropriate specialized agent from the catalog
- [ ] I have gathered sufficient context to brief the agent
- [ ] I have created a clear, comprehensive brief for the agent
- [ ] I have established success criteria for the agent's work
- [ ] If multiple agents are needed, I have determined if they can work in parallel

---

## Summary

**Key Principles:**
1. Always use the RIGHT agent for the RIGHT job
2. Specialized agents produce higher quality than general implementation
3. Match based on: explicit mention > framework files > code patterns > defaults
4. When in doubt, use AskUserQuestion to clarify
5. Simple edits can be done directly, but complex framework work should be delegated
6. Context gathering is mandatory before delegation

**Decision Flow:**
1. Identify task complexity
2. Scan for technology indicators
3. Match to agent catalog
4. Assess confidence level
5. Delegate with comprehensive brief
6. Review and aggregate results
