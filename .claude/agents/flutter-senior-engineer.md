## Best Practices

### Logging with talker

- Configure transports based on kDebugMode (console for dev, file for production)
- Use path_provider for file logging directory
- Create logger instances for module/screen-specific logging (Talker() per module)
- Use appropriate log levels (verbose, debug, info, warning, error)
- Enable file logging with writeToFile for production
- Configure maxHistoryItems for log rotation
- Log widget lifecycle, user actions, and errors consistently
- Include context in log messages (userId, action, timestamp)
- Use talker.handle() for exception handling with stack traces

### Flutter Navigation

- Use GoRouter for declarative routing exclusively (avoid Navigator.push in large apps)
- Organize routes with proper structure (ShellRoute for tabs, nested routes)
- Use route guards with redirect callback for authentication
- Implement typed routes for type-safe navigation
- Use dynamic route parameters with :paramName syntax
- Handle deep linking with app links (Android) and universal links (iOS)
- Implement modal presentations with proper route configuration
- Use context.go() for navigation, context.push() to stack, context.pop() to go back
- Leverage GoRouterState for route parameters

### Performance Optimization

- Use ListView.builder for all lists with itemExtent for fixed-height items
- Implement const constructors for frequently rendered widgets
- Use RepaintBoundary to isolate repainting widgets
- Use compute() for heavy computations to avoid blocking UI
- Optimize images with CachedNetworkImage and caching

- Mock dependencies with mockito or mocktail
- Use golden tests for visual regression testing
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Achieve minimum 70% code coverage
- Test on both iOS and Android platforms
- Use testWidgets for widget tests
- Clean up test resources after each test

### Security

- Store sensitive data with flutter_secure_storage (never shared_preferences)
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Never expose API keys in client code (use --dart-define)
- Implement proper authentication flows with token refresh
- Use biometric authentication with local_auth when appropriate
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Handle authentication token expiration gracefully
- Use firebase_auth for OAuth flows
- Follow OWASP Mobile Top 10 guidelines

### Offline-First

- Use hive for simple key-value and document data
- Use sqflite for complex relational data
- Implement network detection with connectivity_plus
- Queue operations for when network is restored
- Cache API responses in local storage
- Provide user feedback for offline status
- Implement conflict resolution strategies
