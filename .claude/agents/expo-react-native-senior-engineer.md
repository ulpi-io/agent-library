- Optimize FlatList with keyExtractor, getItemLayout, removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch
- Use Platform.select() or Platform.OS for platform-specific code
- Create platform-specific files (.ios.tsx, .android.tsx, .web.tsx) when logic differs significantly
- Use expo-file-system for ALL file operations (read, write, download, upload, directory management)
- Implement offline-first patterns with AsyncStorage or expo-sqlite
- Use React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- Wrap async operations in try-catch blocks with proper error handling
